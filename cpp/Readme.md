# C++ Version of OAuth2 authentication

To compile and run the main oauth2 example you can use this command:

```
./main.sh
```

You can test individual elements by running the relevant bash script.

## Libraries

Normally you can use libraries to do things such as JSON parsing and a small HTTP client and server.  Here we have implemented basic functionality as a teaching aid.  Not all the code is written in the same style - this is on purpose to demonstrate different readability styles.

## References

All references used to create these examples are quotes in the source files.  Most have been significantly altered to improve readability or to carry out the required functionality.
